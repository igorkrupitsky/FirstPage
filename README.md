This Windows application lets you delete all of your pages from your PDF files except for the first one.

## Introduction
This complete Windows application lets you delete all of your pages from your PDF files except for the first one. 
This is useful for file indexing when the information you want to index is located on the first page. It uses free iTextSharp library.

## Using the Code
To use this program, simply select a folder and click Process. The program will delete old PDF files and create a new file in its place with just the first page. 
It will do the same with each subfolder. Please make sure to BACKUP the old folder!!!
